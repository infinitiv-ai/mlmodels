# mlmodels : Model ZOO


This repository is the ***Model ZOO for Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Gluon, LightGBM, Keras, Sklearn models etc*** with Lightweight Functional interface to wrap access to Recent and State of Art Deep Learning, ML models and Hyper-Parameter Search, cross platforms that follows the logic of sklearn, such as fit, predict, transform, metrics, save, load etc. 
Now, more than **60 recent models** (> 2018) are available in those domains : 
* Time Series, 
* Text classification, 
* Vision, 
* Image Generation,Text generation, 
* Gradient Boosting, Automatic Machine Learning tuning, 
* Hyper-parameter search.

With the goal to transform Script/Research code into re-usable batch/code with minimal code change, we used functional interface instead of pure OOP. This is because functional reduces the amount of code needed which is good to scientific computing. Thus, we can focus on the computing part than design. Also, it is easy to maintain for medium size project. 

A collection of Deep Learning and Machine Learning research papers is available in this repository.

## Benefits :

Having a simple  framework for both machine learning models and deep learning models, without BOILERPLATE code.
Collection of models, model zoo in Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras allows richer possibilities in model re-usage, model batching and benchmarking.

Unique and simple interface, zero boilerplate code (!), and recent state of art models/frameworks are the main strength 
of MLMODELS. Different domain fields are available, such as computer vision, NLP, Time Series prediction, tabular data classification.
